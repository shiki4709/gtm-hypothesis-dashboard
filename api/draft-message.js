About them:
- Full name: ${name}
- Headline: ${headline}
- Post topic: ${post_title}
${comment ? `- Their comment: "${comment}"` : '- They liked the post (no comment)'}

TONE RULES — this is the most important part:
- Write like a real human texting a coworker, NOT like a sales robot
- Lowercase "i" is fine. Abbreviations are fine. Casual grammar is fine.
- Reference something SPECIFIC — their comment, their company, their role, or the post topic
- If they commented, react to what they actually said. Don't summarize it back to them. Respond like a human would.
- NO filler phrases: "would love to connect", "thought it'd be cool", "great to have you in my network"
- NO corporate speak: resonated, insightful, curious, fascinating, align, synergy, leverage, thrilled
- NO em dashes, NO exclamation marks, NO emojis
- NO questions
- NO pitching

REAL examples that get accepted (notice how casual and specific they are):
"hey ${firstName}, read your comment on that GTM post, you nailed it. similar world here."
"saw your take on the hiring piece, been thinking the same thing at our shop."
"we're both in the revenue ops trenches apparently. figured we should be connected."
"your comment on that post caught my eye, spot on about the process piece."
"noticed you're at ${comment ? 'the same stage' : 'a company doing interesting stuff'}. connecting."

Write ONE message. Make it feel like something a real person would actually type on their phone at 10pm. Short. Specific. No fluff. Output ONLY the message, nothing else.`;
